							<h2>Unity Coding Adventures</h2>
							<p>I used Unity to work on some of my personal programming projects.</p>
							<ul class="alt">
								<li>Flocking Simulation: A simple program that emulates the flocking behavior of birds and fish (referred to as boids). It is based on the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/imagine/files/2014/10/flocks-hers-and-schools.pdf">Flocks, Herds, and Schools paper by Craig Reynolds.</a></li>
								<li>Procedurally Generated Worlds: I used the Perlin Noise algorithm to create a randomly generated terrain with hills, shores, and bodies of water.</li>
								<li>Vision and Navigation: I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding in a grid world. I also developed an algorithm to calculate field of vision.</li>
								<li>Currently working on creating a turn-based strategy game using the Unity Test Runner to create unit and system tests. So the inevitable bugs won't be too hard to find.</li>

							<h2>NASA Community College Aerospace Scholars</h2>
							<p>For our capstone project, my team and I worked on making a robot capable of filming a sporting event (sprint/marathon specifically). This project was a prototype that is part of a $600,000 research grant
							(which you can read more about in the link below).</p>
							<ul class="alt">
								<li>I was responsible for interfacing with the onboard navigation system (GPS, Motor Controls), using python to control the robots speed and direction relevant to the person it was filming.</li>
								<li>We used the python OpenCV library to detect the runner and keep him/her at a safe distance.</li>
								<li>We used two motors and the 3D-printed pan-tilt camera system to keep the runner in frame.</li>
								<li>Some shins were hurt in the making of this robot.</li>

							<h2>NASA Community College Aerospace Scholars</h2>
							<p>I joined nine other scholars at JSC NASA to partake in a rover building competition. We were tasked with building a model rover (yes, out of Lego) in order to collect rock samples and
							identify minerals all while managing our budget and our time.</p>
							<ul class="alt">
								<li>I acted as Lead Software Engineer, writing the programs that controled the rover.</li>
								<li>I communicated with the budget manager, hardware engineer, and test enegineer to unify our vision of the rover.</li>
								<li>We were the only team to attempt to retrieve the rock sample from Olympus Mons <i>(see image)</i>. We failed valiantly.</li>
								<li>Lollipop man safely returned home after braving the Martian landscape.</li>

							<h2>My Skills</h2>
							<p>A quick overview of the skills I've learned.</p>
							<div class="items style1 big onscroll-fade-in">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>C / C++</h3>
									<p>I've programmed in C/C++ throughout my career. Currently, I use it to develop new features for my company's data-acquisition hardware drivers and integrate them with the software applications we provide.
									I understand the ins-and-outs of the language and the common libraries that extend (e.g. boost).</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-code-branch"></span>
									<h3>Software Development Tools</h3>
									<p>I work in an Agile environment (scrum), using Azure DevOps to track bugs and features (and when bugs are declared features). My team were the first to switch to using Git for source control,
									as part of a company wide initiative to transition away from Perforce. So I have used both Git and Perforce professionally.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major brands fa-python"></span>
									<h3>Python</h3>
									<p>Python is my go to programming language when I want to create a quick and simple program. I've used it for parsing files and extracting key information, prototyping some ideas, or searching and pulling
									information from the web.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-brain"></span>
									<h3>Machine Learning & AI</h3>
									<p>I have taken two courses on ML and AI: Intro to Machine Learning & Fundementals of Artifical Intelligence. I am familiar with linear & logistic regression, neural networks, 
									deep learning, random forests, support vector machines, and clustering algorithms. I am also familiar with AI concepts like reinforcement learning and search algorithms (A*).</p>
								</section>
								<section id=skills>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-cubes"></span>
									<h3>C# & Unity</h3>
									<p>I use C# as a scripting language. I have used it to create all of the Unity projects mentioned above. 
									I also have extensive knowledge of Unit's physics, animation, and design tools (e.g. creating custom editors).</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-cube"></span>
									<h3>3D Animation</h3>
									<p>I am familiar with the basics of 3D animation, modeling, rigging, and rendering. I typically use Blender. See the gallery for some of my work.</p>
								</section>
								<!--
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-users"></span>
									<h3>Teamwork</h3>
									<p>I have been part of a bunch of different and unique teams through out my academic and professional career. I've worked with small teams of one or two other computer engineers, but I 
									also have worked alongside teams of ten or more people who did not share my technical background. If that is not convincing enough, our senior design team won the Teamwork Award at UT Dallas
									Senior Design Showcase.</p>
